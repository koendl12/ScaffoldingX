# ScaffoldingX

Machine learning to accelerate 3D printing of organoids

Scaffoldingx aims to leverage the power of machine learning techniques to radically improve design, material tuning, process optimization, and in situ monitoring of 3D bioprinting.

- In bioprinting, 3D printing techniques are used to combine cells and biomaterials to create tissues
- Bioprinting has quickly become one of the leading segments of the 3D printing industry
- Applications include organoids for next generation drug screening, medical implants, and cultured meats

Mass production of organoids (tissue from organs) are vital to mitigating problems created via the human condition, as such - chronic illness, accidents (fires, car collisions, natural disasters, diseases such as cancer, diabetes). 3D printing of organoids (or bioprinting) has quickly become one of the leading segments of the 3D printing industry in terms of innovation. Thanks to 3D printing techniques, cells and biomaterials can be combined and deposited layer by layer to create biomedical developments that have the same properties as living tissues (Figure 1). During this process, various “bio-inks” (a combination of cells and gel) can be used to create these tissue-like structures. This field has opened the possibility of creating synthetic skin, cornea or bladders for personalized medicine, high throughput testing of drugs for efficacy and toxicity and leading on to organ replacement. organoids can be used for a wide range of applications such as autologous cell therapy breast reconstruction, bone and cartilage implants, and high throughput drug screening 


The 3d bioprinting industry is looking to mitigate challenges related to suboptimal use of materials to make bioprinted organoids more ubiquitous. The potential clients of Scaffoldingx would be 3d bioprinting companies, bioink manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies with bioprinting capabilities looking to print 3d organoids at scale. 
The global 3D bioprinting market size was valued at USD 1.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.8% from 2021 to 2028. The growth of this market is attributed to a limited number of organ donors, and an increasingly aging population with chronic diseases. Rising R&D investment, technological advancement, and increasing incidence of chronic diseases are other vitally impacting attributes, likely to boost market growth during the forecast period. 
Currently, there are  20 companies worldwide that actively use bioprinting to manufacture organoids (or living tissues) and 28 companies worldwide that manufacture materials for bioprinting. Pharmaceutical companies like GSK and Norvartis are exploring this technology for high throughput drug screening[5]. hese companies face challenges in mass producing organoids due to sub-optimal selection of materials and scaffolding creation and struggle with organoids that are not viable. Machine learning techniques can design appropriate materials, determine the concentration of these materials and predict scaffold structure for current bioprinting protocols.
